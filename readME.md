# SVG Generator

## Description

Using inquirer and some classes users are able to create SVG files following a certain template

The SVG file will appear as a new file in the main directory labeled 'logo.svg'

## Usage

Using inquirer the users are given 4 prompts to choose the shape, shapeColor, text, and textColor. This will result in creating or updating the 'logo.svg' file as shown below

If you open the SVG file on the browser this is what you should see
